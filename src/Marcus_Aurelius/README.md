Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.
The impediment to action advances action. That which stands in the way becomes the way.
Dwell on the beauty of life.
We live only now. Everything else is either passed or is unknown.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.
