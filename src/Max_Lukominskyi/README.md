All the opportunities for growth are beyond your comfort zone
Luck comes to those who work hard.
Success equals perseverance.
You cannot be everywhere and have everything. Learn to make right choices and commit to things that matter most.
The world is full of injustice.
There is no perfect moment to start. Do not wait for better moment. It will never come.
Later often means never.
Life has already begun. There is no interlude. Nor is there trial version of life. Your every decision matters.
