We need much less than we think we need.
The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.
If youâ€™re always trying to be normal you will never know how amazing you can be.
Determine to live life with flair and laughter.
