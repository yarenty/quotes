To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work.
Finally I saw that worrying had come to nothing. And gave it up. And took my old body and went out into the morning, and sang.
For me the door to the woods is the door to the temple.
I want to be light and frolicsome
Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable.
