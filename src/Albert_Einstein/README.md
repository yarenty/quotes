I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.
...a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best for both the body and the mind.
I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.
Time flies when you are having fun.
A question that sometimes drives me hazy â€” am I or are the others crazy?
