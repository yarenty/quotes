You can only fight the way you practice
To know ten thousand things, know one well
Know your enemy, know his sword
Get beyond love and grief|exist for the good of man
If you wish to control others, you must first control yourself
Do nothing that is no yourselfThere is timing in everything
Step-by-step walk the thousand mile road
Immature strategy is the cause of grief
By knowing what exist you can know that which does not exist
Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye
All things entail rising and failing timing you must be able to discern this
There is timing in everything
Think lightly of yourself and think deeply fo the world
Examine your environment
You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain
Respect Buddha ant the Gods without counting on their help
Fixed formation is bad|study this well
In strategy you must know the ways of other schools
Without the correct principle the fight cannot be won
Timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal of practice
Strategy id the craft of the warrior
From one thing know ten thousand things
Today is victory over yourself of yesterday|Tomorrow is your victory over lesser me
A thousand days of training to develop|Ten thousand days of training to polish
It is said the warriors is the twofold way of pen and sword
Nobody is strong and nobody is weak|if he conceives of the Nobody
There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get|better|stronger|richer|smarter|everything is within|everything exist|seek nothing outside of yourself
