Accept everything just the way it is
Do not seek pleasure for its own sake
Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling
Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world
Be detached from desire, your whole life long
Do not regret what you have done
Never be jealous
Never let yourself be saddened by a separation
Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others
Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love
In all things have no preferences
Be indifferent to where you live
Do not pursue the taste of good food
Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need
Do not act following customary beliefs
Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful
Do not fear death
Do not seek to posses either goods or fiefs for your old age
Respect Buddha and other Gods without counting on their help
You may abandon your own body, but you must preserve your honor
Never stray from the way
