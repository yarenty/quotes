Not every lake dreams to be an ocean. Blessed are the ones who are happy with whom they are.
If you are a student, try to be a teacher; if you are a teacher, try to be a student!
A beautiful morning is not a guarantee for a beautiful afternoon! Just like a man of desert appreciates water, value well whatever beauty you have now!
Blessed are the ones who are happy with whom they are.
