Men have become the tools of their tools.
.. my wealth is not possession but enjoyment
It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see..
The cost of something is the amount of life which is required to be exchanged for it.
We are happy in proportion to the things we can do without.
There are moments when all anxiety and stated toil are becalmed in the infinite leisure and repose of nature.
If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment.
All good things are wild, and free.
Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.
I make myself rich by making my wants few.
