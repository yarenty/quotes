We become what we think all day long.
The first wealth is health.
You cannot do kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.
Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.
Character is higher than intellect.
The soul active sees absolute truth; and utters truth, or creates.
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.
In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.
If the stars should appear but one night every thousand years how man would marvel and adore.
When it is dark enough, you can see the stars.
A great man is always willing to be little.
Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously.
Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air.
Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.
