We become what we think all day long.
The first wealth is health.
You cannot do kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.
Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.
Character is higher than intellect.
The soul active sees absolute truth; and utters truth, or creates.
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.
In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.
