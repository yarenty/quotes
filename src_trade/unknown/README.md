Cheap things are not valuable, valuable things are not cheap.
Fear not hesitate, afraid to stay.
If you stumble and fall, it does not mean that you go the wrong way.
Do not worry if you do not know, be afraid do not learn.
If you make mistake it is better to laugh instantly.
If you don't change direction then you may just end where you've headed.
